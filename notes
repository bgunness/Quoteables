            - destroy quote with id matching button pushed
            - update button id's to match quote it's attached to (dynamic)

    *BUG*
        - there exists a quote with source 'Lincoln ' 
        - searching for 'lincoln' returns both quotes with sources that include and omit the space after 'lincoln' 
        - searching for 'lincoln ' returns only the quote with the source that includes the space 
            - fix: no matter what the search term is in regards to spaces, return all quotes with that source
            - prepare for omission of commas, periods, for longer names
    *BUG*
        - clicking at very bottom of quote within 'inspiration-all' doesn't apply overlay div 
        - issue is with selecting parents of e.target, 'yes' is not a parent of itself
    *BUG*
        - searching is overly sensitive, searching for any character in the source name returns that source
            - 'a' should return nothing
            - 'apple' should return nothing
            - 'applebees' should return 'Applebees'
            - ? disregard checking for spaces

        Configure MySQL with Sequelize
        Reconfigure models if necessary

** IMPORTANT
    net start/stop mysql in /bin --- use to interact with maria, cannot run same time as xampp
        xampp needs to run for this app to run
