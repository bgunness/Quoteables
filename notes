        - create new view
        - create route 
        - create function to return quotes from database
            - ensure ID is returned and passed to view for delete button
        - call function in GET request
        - pass to view 
    Want to add a function to delete quotes from database
        - ? utilizes view that displays all quotes
            - select 'delete' button next to quotes
            -  ? button has id of quote it's attached to
        - create POST route to view
            - destroy quote with id matching button pushed
            - update button id's to match quote it's attached to (dynamic) 

            for each quote printed, create button with matching id
                button id = quote.id (pk) 
            when button clicked, destroy quote, remove entry, reassign button values

            or instead of dyanmic button id, child button disappears when quote destroyed? (parent is
